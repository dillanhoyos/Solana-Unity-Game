## Inspiration
We believe that staying healthy is a fundamental right of every human being. We are passionate about helping people achieve their goals through healthy eating habits.  

## What it does
Our app enables people to track and document their daily eating lifestyle and then earn NFT and rewards if they are on track. A user can download our mobile app to take pictures of the food they are eating at a point in time, the app then uses image recognition to identify the type of food and then award tokens based on how healthy (calorie count) the food is.  If the user continues eating healthy, they can continue to earn tokens. The tokens can later be exchanged in the app marketplace to purchase more features for their NFT.

## How we built it
Our tech stack includes:
**Frontend:** Unity (C#), Solana.net (Solana integration package), Agora (Android camera native integration)
**API:** AI/ML image recognition (logmeal.es)
**Backend:** Solana L1 Blockchain

## Challenges we ran into
1. Using the image recognition algorithm to recognize the type of food after pictures are taken.
2. Connecting unity app with Solana protocol to update smart contracts was very difficult
3. We had to make a critical choice on which Blockchain to use. We went for Solana because it was easy to integrate with Unity

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
1. The team worked hard and made sure that the mobile app could recognize the picture of the food
2. We made sure to design an easy to use mobile UX for non-web3 users
3. We were able to build a complete MVP for the app

## What we learned
1. Its important to have a team with diverse experience that can contribute a different perspective to the projects
2. We had to develop new skills on how to integrate Solan with Unity app

## What's next for Buffet
1. We plan to improve the algorithm to more diverse food images
2. We would like to launch a beta version of the application
